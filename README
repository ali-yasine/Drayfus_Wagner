Compile using make then run the executable and optionally pass it the size of the graph(300 is default) and the number of terminals(8 is default)
3rd optional parameter is choosing to run the algorithm on cpu or not (1 or 0 default is 1)

example: ./dw 400 10 
         ./dw 2500 8 0 (doesn't run on cpu)
